Feature: Transient disposable feature objects disposed after feature 2

As a tester,
I need my transient disposable feature dependencies to be automatically disposed,
so that their resources are freed.

We need to make sure that transient disposable feature dependencies are disposed after 
each feature. Because we have no way to determine in what order the features are going 
to be executed, we need write this feature twice and write a hacky scenario.
	
    @ninject
    Scenario: Transient disposable feature dependencies 1 are disposed after feature

    Transient disposable feature dependencies are disposed after feature execution
    when we use Ninject.

        Given I have injected TransientDisposableFeatureDependency2 in the binding class StepClassDisposableAfterFeature
        Then TransientDisposableFeatureDependency1 has been disposed if the previous feature had to dispose it
	    
    @bodi
    Scenario: Transient disposable feature dependencies 1 are not disposed after feature

    Transient disposable feature dependencies are not disposed after feature execution
    when we use BoDi.

        Given I have injected TransientDisposableFeatureDependency2 in the binding class StepClassDisposableAfterFeature
        Then TransientDisposableFeatureDependency1 has not been disposed if the previous feature had to dispose it
